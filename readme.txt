== Description ==

When this plugin is installed, the following 7 blocks are registered and can be used not only in the block editor but also in the site editor (tested on WordPress 6.3). In principle, each block can be configured with basic styles such as text color, background color, border, and white space, and in some cases it is also possible to set shadows and icons. There are also some that have simple animations set.
Below is a brief explanation of each block.
1 Design Title
A block that allows you to style HTML heading tags. In addition to the normal style, we have prepared a type that allows you to insert a circular marker, and a type that allows you to add sub copies and icons.
2 Design Text Control
This is a block that allows you to style text controls and text area controls for HTML input elements. This time, we have prepared a normal box type and a line type. It is now possible to display required inputs, and it is a block that can be used for validation checks as an inner block of the Guest Contact Block, which will be released soon.
3 Design CheckBox
This is a block that allows you to style checkboxes in HTML input elements. Check animation. At the moment, we only have one type available, but we plan to gradually offer other variations in the future.
4 Design Select
A block that allows you to style HTML SELECT elements. It boasts that the selection element moves with a slightly fancy animation. Supports single selection and multiple selection.
5 Design Process
A block for displaying the input process of form input. It is assumed that it will be used as an inner block for the Guest Contact Block, which will be released soon, and this block will not work on its own.
6 Code HighLight
This block allows you to enter code in the text area in edit mode and highlight it on the front end. This block uses the Google Code Prettify library for highlighting.
7　Draggble Box
Unlike other blocks, it is used by setting an inner block. You can change the placement of the set blocks by dragging them. By inserting image blocks, etc., you can create styling that shifts the placement.
